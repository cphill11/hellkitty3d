h/o Hellspawn: 
Leaving the pumpkin patch the Pumpkin Queen has arrived in Azeroth to fight along side the Horde with her Warlock skills...with her friends at Davey Jones Locker.

She is the "in your face" girl who will be found where she is needed most. With the spirit of the Hallowed Night in her soul she is both a bit crazy with a touch of madness. Alice in wonderland holds no candle to Hellspawn as she is just as crazy as the mad hatter with the ferocity of a tornado at the same time. 

From the fun flirty girl to the fire wielding of hell itself she knows how to always have fun ...and leave the fields ablaze in her wake. She has been on the battlefields since the creation of the game, From raiding instances with her guilds to waging war on the PvP grounds she has been through it all.  

( Quote section of the narrative) Hellspawn " Through so many years an so many battles..I've seen many come and go and seen a great many things..I have made lifelong friends and fought beside some of the best, I have never backed down from the challenges that have arrived on my doorstep...and done my best to overcome them..with my truth never silent. I have raided dungeons with a select groups and waged war against other players in the fields.
